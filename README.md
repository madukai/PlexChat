Hi,

Foreword:

First of all, I want to give my gratitude for PlexChat for giving me this opportunity to work on a React Native App (Android), this is my very first time to worked on a React Native framework and 
I learned a lot during the development of the coding exercise app and most of all, I have fun working on it.

Let's get down to the app.

App Title: Rock-Paper-Scissor (App Game)

Description:
 The app is a simple game of rock-paper-scissor game against a computer.
 I also have a similar app, but I developed it using Unity Game Engine.
 GitHub Link:
 https://github.com/madukai/UnityRPS

Instructions: 
 - Player will select between rock-paper-scissor using the button.
 - After the player have made a selection, the cpu will select.
 - After the player and cpu made their selection, the game will determine who wins the round and adds 1 pt to the winning side
 - Win Condition: first one to reach 5 pts.

Bug:
 - There's a bug on the app, when app changes it orientation from portrait to landscape, the score display disappears 
   and the text that displays who won that round is placed on between the image, instead of under it.


Time Spent:

Total: 3 hours

April 30, 2017 (Sunday):

1 Hour: Implementing React Native navigation between scenes

3 Hours: Working on the whole game logic and design of the game

1 Hour: Testing the app

Total: 5 hours


If I have more time, I would implement the following features:
- Fixed the bug I mentioned
- Organize the code more, by breaking the down the code a bit more
- Add background music and sound effects
- Add 2 player mode thru networking (This is probably more advance with my current knowledge with React Native)


My main concern, before I worked on this coding exercise is that if I can setup the React Native Framework on my system, but fortunately it turns out pretty well.
I really liked this coding exercise because of freedom of I can do whatever I want, compare to other companies' coding exercise.
